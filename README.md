# SIngle-Analysis

## About Single Analysis
This app, is a Rshiny developed app that integrates different analysis that can be performed at a single sample level on scRNA-Seq data. The app is part of Ignasi Jarne Sanz's master's final thesis in bioinformatics and biostatistics.
This app has been uploaded in a GitHub repository, hoping that it will be useful for researchers or students that are not into informatics to do their analysis. It is important to highlight that this app has not been developed with the purpose of being used at a clinical level.
